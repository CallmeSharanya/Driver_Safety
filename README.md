This Python-based project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect drowsiness by monitoring eye aspect ratio (EAR) in real-time via a webcam. When drowsiness is detected, an alert sound is played to notify the user.<br>

<h3>Features</h3>
Real-Time Eye Tracking: Monitors the userâ€™s eyes via a webcam.<br>
Drowsiness Detection: Detects drowsiness based on eye closure using EAR.<br>
Audio Alert: Plays an alarm sound when drowsiness is detected.<br>
Custom Threshold: Configurable EAR threshold for alert triggering.<br>
